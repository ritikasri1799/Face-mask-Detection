# Face-mask-Detection
A face mask detection dataset consists of a mask and without mask images, we are going to use OpenCV to
do real-time face detection from a live stream via our webcam. We will use the dataset to build a COVID-19
face mask detector with computer vision using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow and Keras
